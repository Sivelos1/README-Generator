  ## Usage

  Run the program in NodeJS and answer its questions.

  ## Collaborators

  Anthony Azzi, and Robert Kaiser

  If you'd like to contribute, please request contribution access on the project's GitHub page, which can be found on my profile at [Sivelos1](https://github.com/Sivelos1), or refer to the [Questions](#questions) section for my contact info!

  ## Tests

  Give the program answers that are very off-topic, to try and find any edge-cases where the program may break.
